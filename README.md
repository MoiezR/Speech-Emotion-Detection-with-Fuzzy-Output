# Speech-Emotion-Detection-with-Fuzzy-Output
In this project I use the Toronto Emotional Speech Set or the TESS dataset. The model primarily makes use of the Long Short Term Memory or LSTM Unit to be trained, it has a linear activation function. The output depicts the degree of membership of each element in the dataset with regards to each of the seven labels.
